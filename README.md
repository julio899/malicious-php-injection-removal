(You can run "find . -type d > subdirectories.txt" at linux command line, convert the output text in to comma separeted array.)

2. Then paste these sub directories in the $subfolders array.

3. Open a malicious code contained file. 

Copy its beginning and ending to the injectedCodeBeginning and injectedCodeEnding variables.

use putty to remote connect your server and type "nano absolutepathtofile/viruscleaner.php" to open it via linux nano text editor.
